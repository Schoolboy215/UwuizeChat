# UwuizeChat
Universal Minecraft forge mod that "uwu-izes" all outgoing chat

This is a forge mod that can either be installed on a client or a server. It does not prevent connecting to vanilla servers and will enhance your chat as it goes out. Likewise, if installed on a server that has only server-side mods, it will allow vanilla clients to connect and alter their chat before it gets transmitted.
